## How To Use:
- Enter collection URL into the "COLLECTION_URL" part of default.py
- Copy "default.py" to a folder in Q:/scripts (ideally Q:/scripts/Alexandria)
- Create a "Downloads" folder in F:/
- Run the script and enjoy!

## Issues:
- The script will crash if a "Downloads" folder on F (or wherever you've pointed it) isn't present. Will add options to automatically detect and create a directory if unavailable later!
- You tell me.
